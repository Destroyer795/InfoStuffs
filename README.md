## Running Locally with Docker
To run this project in a local containerized environment, ensure you have Docker Desktop installed and follow these steps:

### Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Destroyer795/InfoStuffs.git
cd InfoStuffs
```
This will download the project files to your local machine.

### Create Environment Files:
You will need to create two `.env` files for the project to run.

- Create a `.env` file in the root directory. You can use the `.env.example` file as a template.

- Create a `.env` file in the `/frontend directory`. Use the `frontend/.env.example` file as a template.

Populate both files with your own keys and secrets (e.g., MongoDB URI, Clerk keys, etc.).

### Build and Run the Containers:
From the root directory, run the following command. This will build the Docker images for both the frontend and backend and start them.

```
docker-compose up --build
```
The `--build` flag ensures that the images are built from the latest version of your code.

### Access the Application:
Once the containers are running, the application will be available at:

Frontend: `http://localhost:8080`

Backend API: `http://localhost:5000`
